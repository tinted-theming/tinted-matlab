# Tinted color schemes for Matlab

Over 250 [Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) color schemes
for Matlab.

Have a look at
[Tinted Gallery](https://tinted-theming.github.io/tinted-gallery/) for examples.

## Applying color schemes

The scheme files in the `schemes/` folder can be applied in Matlab using
the included `tinted_import` function:

- `tinted_import()` with no input will prompt the user to locate the
color theme source file via the GUI.

- `tinted_import(FILENAME)` imports the color scheme options given in
the file FILENAME.
